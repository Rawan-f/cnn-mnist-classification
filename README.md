# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Classify Handwritten Digits Using MNIST Dataset

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Keras and TensorFlow.

## Project Overview

The project uses the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits, to build and train a CNN model for digit classification. The model is built with the following layers:
- Convolutional layers (to extract features)
- MaxPooling layer (to reduce spatial dimensions)
- Fully connected layers (for classification)

## Results

After training the model for 10 epochs, the accuracy on the test set was approximately **83.18%**.
